I'm currently on the journey to completing "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" course from Udemy. My goal is to become an expert of python so I chose to take this course in the hope it would provide structure, guidance and accountability while "self-learning". Along with my udemy course I'll also be supplementing my learning with books and videos.
